# Advanced-Linear-Regression
In this project, I aimed to go beyond the basics and explore advanced linear regression techniques. My goal was to build a highly predictive model for house prices while ensuring,interpretability, robust validation, and feature engineering grounded in domain knowledge. This project also served as a valuable addition to my data science portfolio.
